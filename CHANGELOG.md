## Unreleased

### Features
- **The customized desktop app is now named Omny.** Its macOS bundle, executable, window title, and visible interface branding use the shorter name while continuing to read the existing OmnySSH configuration directory.
- **Per-host terminal startup commands.** A host can now send a configured command immediately after its interactive shell opens, enabling nested SSH and privilege-switch workflows on bastions that prohibit `ProxyJump` forwarding. Dashboard metrics and SFTP continue to target the configured host itself.
- **Dashboard cards can be reordered by drag and drop.** A dedicated grip moves cards, and the preferred order persists across app restarts while new hosts append naturally.
- **The desktop UI is focused on local operations.** Upstream update checks, update settings/banner, About Omny, the automatic SSH-key setup flow, and the redundant Snippets/Terminal sidebar entries are removed. Terminal sessions remain available from each host card's `sh` action.
- **SSH and SFTP are peer navigation actions.** The SSH host picker now sits directly below SFTP in the sidebar, while Settings and theme switching share the footer in that order.

### Bug Fixes
- **Desktop terminal output now renders reliably on macOS WebKit.** PTY chunks use Tauri's portable serialized byte-array channel instead of the raw `ArrayBuffer` response path that could silently deliver no output. The output route is registered before the SSH task starts, and output that beats `terminalOpen` is held backend-side until xterm explicitly acknowledges readiness, then flushed in order and refreshed, so a fast quiet shell's first prompt appears immediately.
- **Command+W closes the active desktop session tab.** On macOS, using the standard close-tab shortcut inside a terminal or SFTP session now closes only that session instead of the entire Omny window. Shell Ctrl+W remains available for readline word deletion.
- **Manual hosts can now be renamed from Edit host.** Renames are persisted atomically, keep saved credentials and key-setup metadata, retain Dashboard ordering, and reject duplicate names instead of creating a second host.
- **The same host can now have multiple terminal tabs.** Every `sh` click opens an independent SSH session, while SFTP remains single-instance per host. Closing the active tab selects a neighbouring session when one exists.
- **Repeated `sh` clicks recover cleanly.** A live or connecting tab is reactivated instead of duplicated, while a failed tab is replaced with a fresh connection attempt.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-07-28

### Bug Fixes
- **Windows: the desktop app no longer opens a console window next to itself.** The GUI was linked as a console application, so Windows gave it a terminal and kept it on screen for the whole session. Release builds now link as a GUI binary. The same fix would have made one-click SSH key setup flash a console of its own while `ssh-keygen` runs, so that is suppressed too. macOS and Linux were never affected.
- **No more white flash when the desktop app launches.** The window used to appear before the webview had painted anything, so the first frame was blank white before the dark (or light) interface took over. The window is now created hidden and revealed once the page is up, with a fallback that shows it anyway if the interface is slow to load.

---

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-24

### Features
- **OmnySSH Desktop — a new native GUI app.** A desktop application built on the same engine as the TUI, sharing your `hosts.toml` and `snippets.toml`. It bundles a live metrics dashboard, a multi-session terminal, an SFTP file manager, command snippets, host management, one-click SSH key setup, a command palette, and light/dark themes. Distributed as native installers (macOS `.dmg`, Linux `.AppImage`/`.deb`, Windows `.exe`). The TUI is unchanged and still installs the same ways. macOS builds are unsigned — on first launch right-click the app and choose **Open** (or install via `install.sh`, which sidesteps the Gatekeeper prompt).
- **File manager hidden-file toggle (`.`)**: show or hide dot-prefixed entries (hidden by default). The `..` parent entry is always shown.
- **Nerd Font file icons in the file manager**: per-type glyphs replace the `[DIR]`/`[   ]` markers. Requires a Nerd Font — without one the glyphs render as empty boxes.

### Changed
- **Terminal next-tab moved from `Tab` to `Ctrl+N`**, freeing `Tab` for the shell's own completion inside the embedded terminal.
- **File manager `h`/`Left` now navigates to the parent directory** (previously moved the cursor up), matching `ranger`/`lf`/`nnn`/`vifm`. Returning to a parent places the cursor on the directory just left.

### Bug Fixes
- **The terminal now handles Cyrillic and other multibyte text.** OmnySSH forwards a UTF-8 locale (and the `IUTF8` PTY mode) to the remote shell, mirroring a normal ssh client's `SendEnv LANG LC_*`. Previously the session could fall back to a single-byte locale, so line editing corrupted the prompt on Cyrillic input and editors like `vim` rendered mojibake (plain `cat` was fine). Applies to both the TUI and GUI terminals. Best-effort — servers that don't accept forwarded env vars are unaffected.

### Packaging
- **Release builds now ship the GUI.** CI bundles native desktop installers for macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux x86_64 (`.AppImage` + `.deb`), and Windows x86_64, attached to each GitHub Release alongside the TUI archives and covered by `SHA256SUMS`.
- **`install.sh` can install the GUI, the TUI, or both** via `--gui` / `--tui` / `--both` (or `OMNYSSH_INSTALL=…`); it prompts when run interactively and defaults to the GUI (the flagship app) for piped `curl | sh`.

### Documentation
- **CONTRIBUTING** now documents the `omnyssh-gui` crate and how to build/test the GUI with the Node/Tauri toolchain.
- Documented the Auto SSH Key Setup feature (`Shift+K`): added a README Features entry, a Quick Start key reference, and a Help popup shortcut. The feature already existed but was undiscoverable.
- README "Development Roadmap" now lists the current `1.1.0` release (and `1.0.5`); it previously stopped at `1.0.4`.
- Removed the dead `connect` keybinding from the `config.toml` example and the `[keybindings]` config struct. Enter-to-connect was always hard-coded, so the field never had any effect.

### Internal
- **Repository converted to a cargo workspace; the engine now lives in its own crate**: The SSH engine, host/snippet/app configuration, metrics parsers, domain events, and the self-updater moved into the new `omnyssh-core` library crate (`crates/omnyssh-core`), which has no dependency on terminal-UI or CLI crates. The TUI application keeps the `omnyssh` package name and the `omny` binary (`crates/omnyssh`) and consumes the core as a regular dependency. This prepares the architecture for additional frontends (e.g. a GUI) without duplicating the engine.
  - The event bus is split: background tasks emit `CoreEvent` values; the TUI wraps them into its own `AppEvent` stream alongside input events.
  - `threshold_color` was replaced by a UI-agnostic `ThresholdLevel` in the core; the colour mapping moved to the TUI theme module.
  - Keybinding parsing (config strings → key codes) and PTY key-to-bytes translation moved from the engine into the TUI crate; the core PTY API accepts raw bytes only.
  - Removed the unused `nucleo` dependency.
  - No user-facing changes: behavior, appearance, the binary name, and install paths are unchanged.
- **Removed leftover Alerts/Deep Probe remnants**: Deleted the unused `[smart_context]` config (`SmartContextConfig` was parsed but never read) and reworded stale "Deep Probe" comments left after the subsystem was removed in 1.0.5. No user-facing change — existing config files containing a `[smart_context]` section still load, as the section is ignored.

---

## 1.0.5 — 2026-06-07

### Bug Fixes
- **docs.rs documentation build fixed**: The build script wrote the generated man page into the source tree (`doc/omny.1`), which fails on docs.rs because it mounts the sources read-only. The man page is now skipped when building on docs.rs (detected via the `DOCS_RS` environment variable); normal builds still generate and check it in as before.

### Internal
- **Dead-code cleanup**: Removed the unimplemented Alerts/Deep Probe subsystem (backend and UI) and a range of unused items — enum variants, struct fields, helpers, and theme colors. No user-facing behavior changes: METRICS and SERVICES on the detail page, the file manager, and the terminal work as before. The crate-level `#![allow(dead_code)]` was dropped so the compiler now catches dead code on its own.

---

## 1.0.4 — 2026-05-29

### Features
- **Terminal now uses the native russh client (fixes the dead Windows terminal)**: The interactive terminal no longer spawns the system `ssh` binary inside a local pseudo-console (ConPTY on Windows). It now runs over the same pure-Rust russh client as metrics and SFTP, so the terminal works identically on every OS — the blank, unresponsive Terminal tab on Windows is fixed. The terminal reuses the app's existing key, SSH agent, password, and `known_hosts` (trust-on-first-use) authentication, so password-auth hosts still connect without prompting and the separate `SSH_ASKPASS` helper has been removed.
  - ProxyJump (`-J`) is not yet supported in the terminal and is refused with a clear message instead of connecting direct; metrics/SFTP never used it. Tracked as a follow-up.
  - Passphrase-protected keys without an SSH agent cannot be unlocked interactively in the terminal anymore. Use an SSH agent or an unencrypted key. On Windows there is no agent fallback yet, so prefer an unencrypted key there.
  - The terminal no longer reads `~/.ssh/config` directly, so exotic directives such as `ProxyCommand` no longer apply (the parsed HostName/User/Port/IdentityFile/ProxyJump still do). This makes the terminal consistent with the rest of the app.

### Security
- Validate public-key format and reject control characters before embedding keys in remote shell commands.
- Sanitize `sshd_config` directive edits and scope the disabled `Include` to the cloud-init drop-in only.
- Store `config.toml`, `hosts.toml`, and `snippets.toml` with `0600` permissions, and remove temp files left by a failed save.
- Reject `..` traversal and null bytes in SFTP upload/download paths.
- Pin all GitHub Actions to commit SHAs and verify release archives against `SHA256SUMS` in `install.sh` (with a `shasum` fallback on macOS).

### Bug Fixes
- **Log files no longer fill the disk**: On startup OmnySSH now prunes rolling log files older than 7 days from its config directory. The cleanup is best-effort and never blocks startup, works on every platform via the native config path, and only touches `omnyssh.log*` files — `config.toml`, `hosts.toml`, and `snippets.toml` are left untouched.
- **Man page now installs reliably**: `install.sh` failed to install the man page into the system directory (e.g. `/usr/local/share/man` on macOS) because it never elevated with `sudo`, so `man omny` reported "No manual entry". The man page is now downloaded to a temp file first and installed with a `sudo` fallback, mirroring the binary install.
- **Remote command exit status is no longer lost** when it arrives after EOF.
- **Multi-file deletes fixed**: all in-flight remote deletes are tracked before the panel refreshes, and every error from a multi-file local delete is reported.
- **Terminal is always restored on exit**, even if an earlier teardown step fails.
- **Docker view scales to many containers**: `docker inspect` is batched to stay under `ARG_MAX`.

### Documentation
- Fixed inaccurate docs: `--verbose` now correctly states logs are written to a log file (not stderr) in `--help`, the man page, and the README; `install.sh` prints the OS-specific config directory; corrected the horizontal split keybinding in the changelog (`Ctrl+]`, not `Ctrl+-`).
- More inaccurate docs corrected: `--theme` is now documented as persisting your choice to `config.toml` (it always wrote the config back, but the README called it temporary); the `[ui]` config example no longer lists `show_ip`, `show_uptime`, `card_layout`, and `border_style`, which are parsed for forward compatibility but not yet wired to the renderer; and the "static binary" wording was corrected since the x86_64 Linux and macOS builds are not statically linked.

### Other
- Removed the vestigial empty `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (left over from an earlier project name); they served no purpose in this Rust project.
- Removed the unused `config/default.toml` template — it was never read by the app, and the README already carries the canonical config example.
- CI now fails if the committed `doc/omny.1` man page drifts from `src/cli.rs`, so the generated man page can no longer go stale.
- Removed dead code with no effect on runtime behaviour: unused functions with no callers (`Screen::title`, `Host::id`, `key_path_for_host`, the superseded `host_list` render path, and two unused popup renderers), plus three methods that were only reachable from their own tests (`FileManagerPanel::clamp_scroll`, `ProbeOutput::section_names`, `KeySetupMachine::password_disabled`) and those tests.
- Made the `sshd` rollback backup lookup portable so it also works on BusyBox/Alpine hosts.

## 1.0.3 — 2026-05-21

### Features
- **Termux / Android support**: Releases now include a statically linked `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` build that runs on Termux. `install.sh` detects Termux via `$TERMUX_VERSION` / `$PREFIX` and installs the binary into `$PREFIX/bin` (and the man page into `$PREFIX/share/man/man1`) without `sudo`.

---

## 1.0.2 — 2026-05-16

### Features
- **Automatic update checks**: On startup OmnySSH checks GitHub Releases for a newer version and shows a popup when one is available. You can install the update, skip that version, or disable checks entirely. Failed or offline checks are silent and never delay startup.
- **In-app self-update**: For manual / `install.sh` installs on Linux and macOS, an update can be downloaded and installed from within the app — the release archive is verified against its SHA-256 checksum before the binary is replaced. Homebrew, Cargo, and Nix installs instead show the matching upgrade command.
- **Top processes on the detail page**: The server detail view now shows the three busiest processes by CPU usage, along with their CPU and memory percentages.

### Bug Fixes
- **Windows double input fixed**: Each keystroke is now registered once instead of twice (e.g. "j" no longer produced "jj"). Key-release events reported by the Windows console are no longer treated as input.
- **Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility**: Linux release binaries are now built against an older glibc, fixing the `version 'GLIBC_2.39' not found` error when running on Ubuntu 22.04 and similarly aged distributions.
- **Mouse scroll inside full-screen apps fixed**: On the Terminal screen, the mouse wheel now scrolls inside `vim`, `less`, `htop`, and other alternate-screen apps. The wheel is forwarded to the foreground application — as native mouse-wheel events when it enabled mouse reporting, or as cursor-key presses otherwise. The normal screen still scrolls local scrollback.
- **Multi-line paste into the terminal fixed**: Bracketed paste is now implemented. Pasting multi-line text into the Terminal screen no longer drops the first characters, and editors like `vim` insert it verbatim without cascading auto-indent.
- **Top processes exclude OmnySSH's own connection**: The detail-page top-processes panel no longer lists OmnySSH's metric-polling SSH connection. Its `sshd` process chain is filtered out by PID, so an idle server shows real workload while SSH sessions from other users still appear.
- **Bracketed paste restored after system SSH**: Connecting to a host via the system `ssh` binary no longer leaves bracketed paste disabled on return, so multi-line paste into the terminal keeps working.
- **Host keys are now verified**: A server's host key is recorded in `~/.ssh/known_hosts` on first connection (trust on first use). A later key change — or an unreadable `known_hosts` — refuses the connection instead of silently accepting an unverified key.
- **Password authentication reliably disabled**: Auto SSH Key Setup now adds the `PasswordAuthentication`, `UsePAM`, and challenge/keyboard-interactive directives when `sshd_config` omits them, so password login is disabled even on configs that previously relied on compiled-in defaults.
- **System SSH launch failure no longer quits the app**: If the `ssh` binary cannot be started, OmnySSH restores the TUI and reports the error in the status bar instead of exiting.
- **Remote command exit status honoured**: SSH command execution now exposes a non-zero remote exit status; the key-setup sudo check uses it to detect missing sudo access correctly.

### Other
- Release archives are now published alongside a `SHA256SUMS` checksum file.
- **Internal refactor**: The oversized `app.rs` was split into focused submodules under `src/app/` (host, snippets, file manager, terminal, update, input, and action dispatch). This is a pure code reorganization with no change in behaviour.
- **Test coverage**: Added unit tests for previously untested core logic — snippet parameter substitution, host/snippet form validation, the SSH-config/manual host merge, `hosts.toml` serialization, form-field UTF-8 editing, host/snippet filtering and sorting, file-panel selection, and terminal pane state.

---

## 1.0.1 — 2026-04-22

### Bug Fixes
- **TUI display corruption fixed**: Log output no longer bleeds through the TUI interface. All logging is now redirected to a log file (`~/.config/omnyssh/omnyssh.log` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/omnyssh/omnyssh.log.*` on macOS) instead of stderr, preventing raw error messages (such as SSH timeout warnings) from corrupting the terminal display during background operations.
- **Error notifications**: Connection failures, discovery timeouts, and snippet execution errors are now displayed as concise notifications in the status bar instead of being silently logged.
- **SFTP connection freeze fixed**: SFTP connections now run in the background with a 30-second timeout, preventing the UI from freezing indefinitely when connecting to slow or unresponsive servers. A "Connecting… (30s timeout)" indicator is displayed during the connection attempt.
- **Terminal scroll fixed**: Two-finger trackpad and mouse-wheel scroll on the Terminal screen now scrolls local scrollback instead of cycling the remote shell's command history. Previously, mouse capture was disabled on the Terminal screen to allow native mouse text selection, which caused host terminal emulators to translate scroll gestures into ArrowUp/ArrowDown keys that bash readline interpreted as history navigation. Mouse capture is now kept on across all screens.
- **Native drag-to-select preserved**: Mouse capture now enables only button and scroll-wheel reporting (`?1000h` + `?1006h`), dropping the aggressive any-motion tracking (`?1002h` / `?1003h`) that crossterm enables by default. In terminals that honor the modifier-bypass for mouse reporting (iTerm2 on macOS, most Linux terminals), hold `Option` (iTerm2) or `Shift` (Linux) while dragging to select and copy text in the Terminal screen without the application intercepting the drag. Note: macOS Terminal.app does not support modifier-bypass for mouse reporting at all — users on Terminal.app should switch to iTerm2 or a similar emulator for in-app text selection.
